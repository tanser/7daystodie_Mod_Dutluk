# Dutluk Mod for 7 Days to Die (v2.2)

## Description

This mod enhances the 7 Days to Die experience by introducing randomized statistics for equipment and adding new, unique items to the game. It aims to make loot more exciting and provide new crafting opportunities.

This mod is compatible with game version 2.2.

## Features

### 1. Randomized Equipment Statistics

This mod dynamically adjusts the stats of newly found or crafted Tier 5 and Tier 6 equipment, providing a range of values instead of a fixed number. This makes every piece of gear potentially unique.

The following stats are randomized:

*   **For all armor pieces (Tier 5 & 6):**
    *   Physical Damage Resist
    *   Elemental Damage Resist
    *   Max Degradation
*   **For all guns, melee weapons, tools, bows, and crossbows (Tier 5 & 6):**
    *   Entity Damage
    *   Block Damage
    *   Max Degradation

### 2. New Items

The following new items have been added and can be found in the Creative Menu:

*   **Mythic Parts (`dutResourceMythicParts`)**
    *   A high-tier crafting resource, extending beyond the legendary tier.
    *   Group: `Special Items`

*   **Cursed Totems (`dutCursedTotems`)**
    *   A mysterious and valuable special item.
    *   Group: `Special Items`

*   **Tier 6 Armor Bundles (e.g., `dutT6LumberjackHelmetBundle`)**
    *   Special bundle items that grant the player 6 of a specific quality 6 armor piece.
    *   Bundles are available for all pieces (helmet, outfit, gloves, boots) of the following armor sets: Lumberjack, Preacher, Rogue, Athletic, Enforcer, Farmer, Biker, Scavenger, Ranger, Commando, Assassin, Miner, Nomad, Nerd, and Raider.
    *   Group: `Special Items,Clothing,Armor,TCArmor`
