# Dutluk Mod for 7 Days to Die (v2.2)

## Description

This mod enhances the 7 Days to Die experience by introducing randomized statistics for equipment and adding new, unique items to the game. It aims to make loot more exciting and provide new crafting opportunities.

This mod is compatible with game version 2.2.

## Features

### 1. Randomized Equipment Statistics

This mod dynamically adjusts the stats of newly found or crafted equipment, providing a range of values instead of a fixed number. This makes every piece of gear potentially unique.

*   **Physical Damage Resist:** For all armor pieces.
*   **Entity Damage:** For all guns, melee weapons, tools, bows, and crossbows.
*   **Block Damage:** For all guns, melee weapons, tools, bows, and crossbows.
*   **Max Degradation:** For all armor, guns, melee weapons, tools, bows, and crossbows.

### 2. New Items

The following new items have been added and can be found in the Creative Menu:

*   **Mythic Parts (`dutResourceMythicParts`)**
    *   A high-tier crafting resource, extending beyond the legendary tier.
    *   Group: `Special Items`

*   **Cursed Totems (`dutCursedTotems`)**
    *   A mysterious and valuable special item.
    *   Group: `Special Items`

*   **Lumberjack Helmet Bundle (`dutLumberjackHelmetBundle`)**
    *   A special bundle item. When used, it grants the player 6 quality 6 Lumberjack Helmets.
    *   Group: `Special Items,Clothing,Armor,TCArmor`
